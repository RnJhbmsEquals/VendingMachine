# Vending Machine Java App

## Analysis
* Vending machine which contains items with name, category, price and stock.
* Appropriate accessor methods
* HashMap mapping the hashCode of an Item as the key to itself as the value.
* Transaction which takes the selected Items and adds their cost then edits the stock value.
* Change making problem within the transaction taking the user's cash and returning correct change from coins available.




## What could be improved
* Realistically there would be many more items in the vending machine with their own hash needed, so a hashmap would make more sense.
